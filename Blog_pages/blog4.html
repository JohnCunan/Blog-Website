          <h1>E3 2022 will be online-only, just like last years event</h1>
          <h4>Jan 6, 2022</h4>
          <h4>By Corbin Davenport</h4>
          <p>
            The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3 for short, has been one of
            the largest yearly events for video games in recent history. The
            initial rise of COVID-19 last year forced the Entertainment Software
            Association (ESA) to move E3 2021 to be online-only, and perhaps
            unsurprisingly, this year’s event will also be entirely online.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Entertainment Software Association told VentureBeat in a
            statement, “due to the ongoing health risks surrounding COVID-19 and
            its potential impact on the safety of exhibitors and attendees, E3
            will not be held in person in 2022. We remain incredibly excited
            about the future of E3 and look forward to announcing more details
            soon.” The ESA didn’t explicitly say if it will host an online
            component, like last year, or if it will simply allow companies to
            handle their own plans. Much like CES, most of the significant
            announcements at E3 are usually broadcasted online (or announced in
            blog posts) by game publishers and developers.
          </p>

            The news comes after many other in-person events are being delayed
            or cancelled outright, following an enormous spike in COVID-19 cases
            across the United States and Europe, due to the newer ‘Omicron’
            variant. Amazon, T-Mobile, Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and other
            companies avoided showing up to this week’s CES 2022 event
            in-person, though the CES event went on as planned with the
            companies who didn’t cancel. The United States alone reported over
            one million cases of COVID-19 in a single day earlier this week.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current spikes in COVID cases could be over by the usual summer
            timeline for E3, but now is around the time when companies reserve
            floor space and finalize show plans. The Entertainment Software
            Association also didn’t handle last year’s E3 all that well — a
            security breach on the organization’s website caused the personal
            information of over 2,000 attendees (including journalists) to
            become public. The leaked data included home addresses, phone
            numbers, names, and email addresses — which also happened in 2019.
