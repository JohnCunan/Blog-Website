          <h1>Best Gaming Pheripherals of 2021</h1>
          <h4>January 16 2022</h4>
          <h4>By Cale Hunt</h4>
          <p>
            Making a switch to PC to handle your fun is a big step, and it's not
            complete without some of the best accessories for PC gaming. Whether
            you've gone with one of the best gaming laptops, best gaming desktop
            PC, or you've navigated stock shortages to build a custom gaming PC,
            this collection of hardware will get you set up the right way.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Best Monitor:
              <span><a href="#">LG UltraGear 27GL850-B monitor</a></span>
              <p>
                Your PC gaming experience is only as good as your monitor, and
                the LG UltraGear 27GL850-B is mighty good. It's a 27-inch screen
                with 2560x1440 (QHD) resolution, it has a 144Hz refresh rate and
                1ms response time, and excellent color and contrast. NVIDIA
                G-Sync means less tearing, and the stand allows for height,
                swivel, and tilt.

              Best Headset:
              <span
                ><a href="#">SteelSeries Arctis Pro headset + GameDAC</a></span
              >
              <p>
                This wired gaming headset doesn't come cheap, but it brings
                unbelievable sound with virtual 7.1 surround, Hi-Res
                certification, and dedicated DAC with amplifier. The quality is
                top-notch, the headset is comfortable to wear for hours at a
                time, and your voice will come through clearly for anyone
                listening. Check out our Arctis Pro + GameDAC review for more
                info. $249 at Amazon
              </p>

            <li>
              Best Keyboard:
              <span><a href="#">SteelSeries Apex Pro keyboard</a></span>
              <p>
                While most gaming keyboards rely on mechanical switches, the
                SteelSeries Apex Pro goes its own way and uses magnetic
                actuation that can be tuned on a per-key basis to get exactly
                the performance and feel you need. Per-key RGB lighting,
                included wrist rest, built-in control display, and overall high
                build quality make this keyboard worth every dollar.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Best Wired Mouse:
              <span><a href="#">Razer Viper 8KHz mouse</a></span>
              <p>
                The Razer Viper 8K features mechanical switches for the
                clickers, 5G optical sensor, and 8K polling rate for exceptional
                performance. It's comfortable, it's built to the usual Razer
                standard, and it's ideal for competitive play. If you want a
                wired gaming mouse, this is the one to get.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Best Wireless Mouse:
              <span><a href="#">Logitech G502 Lightspeed mouse</a></span>
              <p>
                If you want to ditch the wires, Logitech's G502 Lightspeed is
                the way to go. It was a HERO 16K sensor and 1ms report rate,
                with support for up to 16,000 DPI. The mouse is comfortable to
                use for long periods, it's built well, and it's going to keep up
                with your skill despite its wireless nature.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Best Gaming Earbuds:
              <span
                ><a href="#"
                  >Razer Hammerhead True Wireless Pro earbuds</a
                ></span
              >
              <p>
                Razer's new Hammerhead earbuds are a true alternative to a full
                headset for gamers. They bring active noise canceling, THX
                certification, customizable EQ, and low latency despite their
                wireless nature. Your voice comes through clear thanks to
                built-in microphones, and the buds come with lots of extra tips
                so that you can find a comfortable fit.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Best Gamepad:
              <span><a href="#">New Xbox Wireless Controller</a></span>
              <p>
                The new Xbox Wireless Controller works with the Xbox Series X|S
                and Windows 10, allowing you to game on your PC with just a
                Bluetooth connection. It's a continuation of the unbeatable
                design, now with a dedicated share button. If you'd rather
                forego a mouse and keyboard, this is the best way to go.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Best Mousepad:
              <span><a href="#">Corsair MM300 Pro</a></span>
              <p>
                Not only is the MM300 Pro mousepad from Corsair big enough to
                handle wide mouse swipes, but it's also spill-proof, so your
                Mountain Dew doesn't soak in when the can tips over. The bottom
                is a bit rubbery to prevent it from slipping around, and the
                top's micro-weave is guaranteed to help your mouse track
                exceptionally well. $23 at Amazon
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After the visual experience comes the aural experience, and we can't
            recommend enough the SteelSeries Arctis Pro + GameDAC headset
            package. The audio it delivers thanks to the bundled amp unit and
            virtual 7.1 surround is unbeatable. These have Hi-Res certification,
            a noise-canceling microphone, and a ton of comfort, so you don't
            have to worry about your ears during a long play session. They sit
            at the top of our best PC gaming headset roundup, and for a good
            reason, as you can see more about in our SteelSeries Arctis Pro +
            GameDAC review.
