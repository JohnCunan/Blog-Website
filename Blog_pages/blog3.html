            Check How to Use Incantations in Elden Ring Elden Ring gives players
            the ability to channel the power of gods or other elemental forces
            through enchantments. These faith-based spells provide players with
            offensive, defensive, and useful effects that offer great
            flexibility in overcoming the game’s many challenges. In terms of
            storage, Elden Ring departs from FromSoftware’s previous game, Dark
            Souls 3, by forgoing attunement and instead allowing players to
            collect unique items to increase the number of summons and spells
            they can equip.
          </p>
          <p>
            The summons in the Elden Ring are reminiscent of the wonders and
            pyromancers from previous FromSoftware games like Dark Souls. They
            work similarly to spells, but use faith instead of intelligence.
            Although summons offer many offensive options, they are very
            different from spells in that they have the ability to restore
            health and cure illness. Following are the steps to use enchantments
            in Elden Ring.
          </p>
          <p>
            How to use enchantments in Elden Ring Before you start getting and
            using enchantments, you will need to equip a holy seal in the Elden
            Ring. Holy Seals are similar to weapons and enchantments are
            ammunition for that weapon. There are different Holy Seals that you
            can buy or get after completing an objective. Like enchantments,
            seals are also related to the attributes of faith. Head to the
            Roundtable Hold to buy a Seal and an Enchantment. You can buy a
            Finger Seal from Twin Maiden Husks for 800 runes in the Roundtable
            Cellar. You can buy enchantments from Brother Corhyn. Now that you
            have the Holy Seal and the enchantments, all you need to do is head
            to the Site of Grace. When you rest on the site, you will get
            different options in the menu. Select Memorize Spell to equip an
            enchantment to a memory slot. Next, select the Gear section and
            equip a Holy Seal. Once you have a sigil equipped, you can conjure
            and cast an enchantment. Final words: How to Use Incantations in
