        <h3>
          Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Is One of the Best Selling Games in
          US History
        </h3>
        <p>February 25, 2022</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is already the 20th best-selling
            game (in dollar sales) since sales tracking for US games began. As a
            result of just those three months of huge sales, Black Ops Cold War
            is now 20th on the NPD's list of best-selling games â€“ although,
            given that they're based on dollar sales, it may be that inflation
            could shift that list somewhat.

          <p>
            Elden Ring gives players the ability to channel the power of gods or

            spells provide players with offensive, defensive, and useful effects
            that offer great flexibility in overcoming the games many
            challenges. In terms of storage, Elden Ring departs from
            FromSoftwares previous game, Dark Souls 3

        <h3>E3 2022 will be online-only, just like last year</h3>
        <p>April 12, 2022</p>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3 for short, has been one of
            the largest yearly events for video games in recent history. The
            initial rise of COVID-19 last year forced the Entertainment Software
            Association (ESA) to move E3 2021 to be online-only, and perhaps
            unsurprisingly, this years event will also be entirely online.
